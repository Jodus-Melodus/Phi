phIDE is a fully-featured IDE specifically designed for the Phi programming language.

## Settings

All the IDE settings can be accessed and changed in the [settings.json](settings.json) file.

## Syntax Highlighting

phIDE provides advanced syntax highlighting for all files, allowing you to easily distinguish between different code elements such as keywords, comments, and strings. This feature enhances code readability and makes debugging easier.

## Support for Multiple Files

phIDE allows you to open multiple files at once, enabling efficient file management and improving productivity. The application displays open files in separate tabs, allowing you to easily switch between them.

## Run Files

phIDE connects to a Phi interpreter when running a file. This ensures that only the current file can be run, preventing potential conflicts with other open files.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

phIDE includes a variety of keyboard shortcuts to enhance user productivity and improve efficiency. By pressing 'F1', users can access a comprehensive list of available shortcuts.

## IntelliSense

## Snippets

The IDE also provides snippets based on the selected language. The snippet menu is the same as the [IntelliSense](#intellisense) but the corners are blue instead of magenta.

## Language Switching

phIDE supports the switching of programming languages through a dropdown menu in the menu bar. This feature allows you to use the IDE for other programming languages or to change the [syntax highlighting](#syntax-highlighting) style to suit your preferences.

## Themes

The theme of the IDE can be changed in the [settings.json](settings.json) file. This will influence how the IDE looks and the syntax highlighting.

## Summary

In summary, phIDE is a versatile and powerful IDE designed specifically for the phi programming language. Its advanced features, including [syntax highlighting](#syntax-highlighting), support for multiple files, run functionality, and an [IntelliSense](#intellisense) and [Snippet](#snippets) feature, make it a user-friendly and efficient tool for Phi programmers.
